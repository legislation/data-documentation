# Legislation.gov.uk Data Documentation

This repository contains the source files for the data documentation for legislation.gov.uk.

The dialect of Markdown used is the [kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/) Markdown superset, as this is the default one used by Jekyll (the static site generator Github Pages uses).

To read the guide, start at the [index page](https://legislation.github.io/data-documentation/).
