# What data we hold on legislation.gov.uk

## Overview

**We only hold a partial dataset of UK legislation texts and metadata**, although we are acquiring more data. This page explains what data we do and do not hold. For an explanation as to why we only hold some data, read our description of the [origins of our data](/origins.md).

### Legislation texts

We hold the text of almost all UK primary and secondary legislation published since 1988, plus the text of some UK legislation published before that date.

Of the legislation we hold published since 1988, we hold most of it in a machine-readable format called [XML](). All legislation held in XML format is available as HTML web pages and [dynamically generated PDF files](), and is also available for full-text search. We also hold revised XML versions of most UK Public General Acts enacted before 1988, as these were [rekeyed from the Statutes in Force volumes]().

Most UK legislation we hold that was enacted or made before 1988 is currently only available as PDF.

We do not hold text of any of the following types of legislation<!--, although we do hold metadata for them-->:

 * Letters Patent
 * Royal Charters
 * Royal Instructions
 * Royal Proclamations

We do hold some legislation originating from the EU, to fulfil our obligations under [Schedule 5 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2018/16/schedule/5). The EU origin legislation we hold is:

 * All EU legislation classified as "legal acts" in the EUR-Lex database (sector 3), plus their consolidated versions (sector 0) and any [corrigenda]()
 * the following EU treaties, both the "Official Journal" version and any consolidated versions:
    + the Treaty on European Union,
    + the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
    + the Euratom Treaty, and
    + the EEA agreement

The [EU Exit Web Archive](https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/eu-exit) holds many other EU documents not published on legislation.gov.uk.

### Changes to legislation

We normally only record amendments _from_ amending documents enacted or made in 1994 onwards. There are some notable exceptions:

 * We have recorded some amendments from "EU implementing" secondary legislation made from 1972 onwards.
 * We have uploaded all amendments by EU documents on other EU documents, which date from 1953, the first year from which legislation was enacted by the European Communities.

There are some types of legislation for which we do not record either changes made by them, changes made to them, or either.
