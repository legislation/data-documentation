## Content derived from EUR-Lex

Some legislation on legislation.gov.uk originates from EUR-Lex, and is published under the duty and powers to publish relevant EU instruments and agreements which are assigned to The King’s Printer (and Chief Executive of The National Archives) in the [European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (c. 16) Schedule 5 Part 1](/ukpga/2018/16/schedule/5/part/1).

Where we have described legislation as ‘originating from the EU’, the item has been derived from EUR-Lex and published on legislation.gov.uk. Browse all legislation originating from the EU to see the documents included in the dataset, which includes Regulations, Decisions, Directives and selected Treaties and Agreements. EU legislation is published subject to the [EUR-Lex copyright notice](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/content/legal-notice/legal-notice.html).

Additional to the legislation types, there are associated documents published alongside the legislation such as Corrigendum (correction slips), and PDF versions of legislation both as originally adopted by the EU and as ‘revised’. We have also published amendment information relating to amendments between EU legislation documents prior to the UK’s exit from the EU, which is derived from the CELLAR. The CELLAR stores and disseminates all content and metadata created or disseminated by the Publications Office of the European Union. It also drives the Publications Office's major portals, including EUR-Lex.
