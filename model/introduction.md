# The legislation.gov.uk data model

Legislation.gov.uk provides many different kinds of data about different things. Our data model describes how the things relate to one another and how we represent information about them in our data.

The key concepts we represent in our data are:

 * Items and subdivisions of **[legislation](legislation.md)**, which represent in abstract a particular law or part independently of its text or any version of it;
 * **[Versions](legislation.md#versions)** of items of legislation and their subdivisions, which embody the text of an item or a given division as it stood at a particular point in time (and, for dual-language legislation, in a particular language);
 * **[Effects](effects.md)** and commencements, where an item of legislation either changes or brings into force one or more provisions of legislation.
