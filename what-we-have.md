# What data we hold on legislation.gov.uk

## Overview

**We only hold a partial dataset of UK legislation texts and metadata**, although we are acquiring more data. This page explains what data we do and do not hold. For an explanation as to why we only hold some data, read our description of the [origins of our data](/origins.md).

### Legislation texts

We hold the text of almost all UK primary and secondary legislation published since 1988, plus the text of some UK legislation published before that date.

Of the legislation we hold published since 1988, we hold most of it in a machine-readable format called [XML](). All legislation held in XML format is available as HTML web pages and [dynamically generated PDF files](), and is also available for full-text search. We also hold revised XML versions of most UK Public General Acts enacted before 1988, as these were [rekeyed from the Statutes in Force volumes]().

Most UK legislation we hold that was enacted or made before 1988 is currently only available as PDF.

We do not hold text of any of the following types of legislation<!--, although we do hold metadata for them-->:

 * Letters Patent
 * Royal Charters
 * Royal Instructions
 * Royal Proclamations

We do hold some legislation originating from the EU, to fulfil our obligations under [Schedule 5 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/id/ukpga/2018/16/schedule/5). The EU origin legislation we hold is:

 * All EU legislation classified as "legal acts" in the EUR-Lex database (sector 3), plus their consolidated versions (sector 0) and any [corrigenda]()
 * the following EU treaties, both the "Official Journal" version and any consolidated versions:
    + the Treaty on European Union,
    + the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,
    + the Euratom Treaty, and
    + the EEA agreement

The [EU Exit Web Archive](https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/eu-exit) holds many other EU documents not published on legislation.gov.uk.

### Changes to legislation

We normally only record amendments _from_ amending documents enacted or made in 1994 onwards. There are some notable exceptions:

 * We have recorded some amendments from "EU implementing" secondary legislation made from 1972 onwards.
 * We have uploaded all amendments by EU documents on other EU documents, which date from 1953, the first year from which legislation was enacted by the European Communities.

There are some types of legislation for which we do not record either changes made by them, changes made to them, or either.

## Limitations

As shown in the History of our Data Collection and Data Completeness sections, the legislation database is both large and complex, with more than 300,000 items of legislation from data collections deriving from different sources. These two factors lead to a number of limitations on the content held within the database:

-   The text of the Statute Law Database, from which much of our revised primary legislation originates, was derived from two earlier official hardcopy editions of revised primary legislation, Statutes in Force (SIF) and The Northern Ireland Statutes Revised (NISR). The final text of SIF was revised to 1 February 1991, and that of NISR to 1 January 2006. These dates form the basedates for SLD legislation, which means the dates from which revision work has been taken forward. There are two main implications of this:
    *   Only primary legislation (e.g. Public General Acts) at least partially in force on or after the basedate of 1 February 1991 is included, and for Northern Ireland only primary legislation at least partially in force on or after the basedate of 1 January 2006
    *   No version history for revised legislation is available prior to these basedates
-	Not all legislation on the website is up-to-date and not all changes to Secondary legislation are in the dataset. If you view a revised version that is not up to date, you will see a red &ldquo;Changes to Legislation&rdquo; banner that will explain which amendments are yet to be applied. You can also find unapplied amendments in the `<ukm:UnappliedEffects>` element in the [XML](/formats/xml.md) representation of a revised item or section of legislation. 
-	Not all documents are available in all formats. For instance, some documents are only available in PDF format. For more information on the formats available on the website and how to access them, see XXXXXX<!--TODO-->.
-	Images within documents do not have ALT text, that is a text describing non-text content such as pictures. ALT text serves several purposes: to allow people with visual or cognitive impairments to read when utilising screen readers; to display a descriptive text in place of a non-loaded image; to provide a semantic meaning to non-text content for search engines.
-	Completeness and accuracy of the data of documents from before the base date cannot be guaranteed as documents might be missing (e.g.: no longer in force, non-print legislation before 2012) or have been rekeyed or OCRed and may contain errors. However, all other legislation - including older versions of revised legislation (post-basedate) - should be present. 

## Data Updates

New legislation is published on legislation.gov.uk simultaneously - as quickly as we can once we are authorised to publish it – which is generally within 48 hours of it being enacted, made or laid, and appears on the New Legislation page and feeds. Any document which is especially complex in terms of its size or its typography may take longer to prepare and, sometimes, we publish PDFs for some items of new legislation before XML is available. Data is sometimes altered after it is first published. This can occur in a few scenarios: a formal correction of the legislation (e.g. a correction slip); the correction of data versions to better represent the official PDF version; or a reprint/reissue of the relevant legislation item.

It is possible to subscribe to the legislation feeds to get details of the latest legislation as soon as it is published without having to check the new legislation page each day. You can find more details about this service by reading the New Legislation page. <!--TI 15/9/22: Do we need to explain here how to subscribe to the feed, considering that many users do not seem to understand how it works? Or should we just improve the guide on the New Legislation page? -->

For revised legislation, information about effects are extracted and added to the Changes to Legislation page as quickly as we can, although it can take up to six weeks if the document is large or if there is a high volume of new legislation (for more information see Our editorial practice and timescales). 

If you are interested in knowing when a document has last changed, it is possible to check this information by opening the XML format of the document and looking at the dc:modified value. To know how to access the XML format of a document, as well as other formats, see XXXXXX<!--TODO-->.

Usually, documents (either enacted or revised) are not removed from legislation.gov.uk except in rare cases with agreement of the originating department where the item was not valid law, e.g. if it was published because of administrative error or if a court judgment has ruled that it was invalid. If data are missing from legislation.gov.uk then this is usually because we do not yet hold it.
