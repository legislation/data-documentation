## Code

We publish some of our code on Github at [@legislation](https://github.com/legislation).

We don&rsquo;t accept pull requests on our repositories, although you are welcome to fork them and reuse the code for your own purposes if you follow the [Open Government Licence](/licence.md). If you&rsquo;ve built something using our code and want to tell us about it, please [contact us](index.md#contact-us) to let us know.

## Schema

We publish our Legislation Schema for CLML, the [XML](/formats/xml.md) format we maintain to describe UK and EU origin legislation. You can download the schema and find documentation for the schema on our [schema]() page.
